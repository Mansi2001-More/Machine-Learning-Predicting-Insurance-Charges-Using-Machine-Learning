# Machine-Learning-Predicting-Insurance-Charges-Using-Machine-Learning
The Medical Insurance Dataset on Kaggle contains information about individuals and their medical insurance charges, with the goal of predicting the insurance premium based on various features. The dataset includes the following columns:

    age: Age of the individual.
    sex: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
    bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI).
    children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
    smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (Yes/No).
    region: The region where the individual resides (e.g., southeast, northwest).
    charges: The target variable, representing the medical insurance charge.

The dataset is typically used for regression tasks to predict insurance charges, based on factors like age, sex, smoking status, BMI, and region. This is a common dataset for building predictive models and exploring factors that influence insurance premiums.
